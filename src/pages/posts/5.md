Mmmm yep.  [Dale's Depravity playlist is now on the music page](/music/).  Now it's just the playlist with a plain text tracklist, that links to my blog about the music so you can opt into yapping.  The [art page](/art/) is now in progress, and I'll slowly upload my art on there.  I'd like it to be a little more than a pure image gallery, I wanna put my yapping on each piece too cuz I put a lot of thought into each piece :3c Hopefully also sortable by tags (characters, sfw, nsfw) eventually?  Wonder if I should make a diff gallery page for NSFW...hmmm
