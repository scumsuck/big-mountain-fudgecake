I feel like their baby daddy drama could be solved if Nancy embraced her inner fujoshi and let John and Dale kiss too. [Whim had a theory](https://wiki.scumsuck.com/blog:2025:0825blaugust_22_ode_to_a_fella_john_redcorn_s_playlist_edition#discussion__section) that John was hitting on Nancy in the episode where she’s balding cuz Dale is also bald. And bald is his pheromone. It’s a good theory!
