Drew this set of guys for a blog post, titled [Ode to a Fella](https://wiki.scumsuck.com/blog:2025:0822blaugust_20_ode_to_a_kind_of_guy).  A lot of cartoon guys I like have a lot in common!  Something very appealing about sad baby daddies.

This is also my first ever John Redcorn drawing!  Hooray!!  I used to watch KOTH as a young lad at my grandpa's house, cuz it came on after the kid's cartoons.  But I never drew him til now... but he's perfect for me.  Long hair, strong nose, big boobs, sensitive heart/prostate.
